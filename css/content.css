/* Styles for elements injected by the content script (e.g., area selection overlay) */

/*
   Note: It's generally better to avoid overly broad selectors here to minimize
   conflicts with the target website's styles. Use specific IDs or classes
   prefixed uniquely for the extension (e.g., .webinsight-overlay).

   The styles for the overlay are currently applied inline via JavaScript in content.js
   for simplicity in the POC. In a production extension, defining them here with
   classes would be cleaner and more maintainable.

/* Example styles if using classes (currently not used by content.js): */
/*
.webinsight-selection-overlay {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: rgba(0, 50, 100, 0.1);
